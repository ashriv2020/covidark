vsce
vsce, short for "Visual Studio Code Extensions", is a command-line tool for packaging, publishing and managing VS Code extensions.

Installation
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

npm install -g vsce

Usage
You can use vsce to easily package and publish your extensions:

$ cd myExtension
$ vsce package
# myExtension.vsix generated
$ vsce publish
# <publisherID>.myExtension published to VS Code MarketPlace

Error
PS D:\vscode\ext\color> vsce create-publisher vscodetok1
 ERROR  Failed request: (401)
 One easy mistake to make when creating the PAT (Personal Access Token) is to not 
 select all accessible accounts/organizations in the Accounts field drop-down
 (instead selecting a specific account). You should also set the Authorized Scopes to Marketplace (Manage) for the publish to work.
